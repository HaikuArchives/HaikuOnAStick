!!!You test this on your own risk!!!

Flashnul are set with flashnul.conf and has these options set.
block-non-removable, block-letter=C, block-number=0

I haven’t test Flashnul on Vista but the rest should work on Vista.

ToDO :
-	An cool image at the top.
-	When you select a download site it can look as nothing happens but HaikuOnAStick are getting some data.

ToThinkAbout
-	Find a way to use an c# app/dll insted of flashnul.exe
-	Add Welcome package so while waiting one can read them?
